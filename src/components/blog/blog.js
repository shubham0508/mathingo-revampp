  <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Super Easy Input:</strong> Seriously, just scanning a problem is genius for printed text.</li>
    <li><strong>Quick Answers:</strong> Need to check if you're on the right track? It's usually super fast.</li>
    <li><strong>It Gives You Steps:</strong> Way better than just an answer! It shows you <em>a</em> path to the solution.</li>

  <h3 id="photmath-cons" class="scroll-mt-20 text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Where Photomath Can Get Tricky:</h3>
  <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-6 space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Handwriting Headaches:</strong> My messy handwriting? Photomath sometimes just laughs at it. It works best with clear, printed text.</li>
    <li><strong>No Multiple questions:</strong> Unable to solve multiple images, multiple questions at same time.</li>
    <li><strong>Word Problem Wall:</strong> Problems written out in sentences can be a real challenge for it to understand accurately.</li>
    <li><strong>Steps Can Be Just Steps:</strong> Sometimes the steps are a bit brief, or they follow a method that isn't the one your teacher taught, which can be confusing. It's great for <em>seeing</em> the process, but maybe not always for deeply <em>learning</em> the process in every style.</li>
